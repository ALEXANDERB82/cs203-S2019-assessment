# cs203-S2019-assessment

This repository contains the assessment sheet for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). The instructor
will add this assessment sheet to a new GitHub Classroom repository each when
the software engineering team is completing an assignment. The instructor
invites each student in the course to master the technical and professional
skills listed on this assignment sheet.

## Improving the Assessment

Please use the GitHub flow model to collaboratively improve the assessment
sheet. First, you should finalize the list of technical and professional skills
on which you want to be assessed during the Spring 2019 semester. Then, you
should describe the student behaviors that would lead to an assessment at one of
the following levels:

* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

Finally, you should explain how the assessment for each of the technical and
professional skills will result in an overall assessment for a software project.

## Problems with the Assessment

If you have any problems with this assessment sheet, then please create an
issue in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site.
